# devTinder

- Created a repository
- Initialize the repository
- node_modules, package.json, package-lock.json
- Installed express.js (npm install express)
- Created a server
- Listen to port: 4000
- Added request handler for "/", "/test"
- Installed nodemon at gloable level (npm install -g nodemon)
- updated scripts in package.json to start the project using nodemon - this will help to restart the server when there is a change in the code upon saving the file without manual restart
